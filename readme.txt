The explanation for each page: 


* Home page: The header part includes the name and a button for accessing the Login page that can link to the Login page. This page navigation bar features links to the Home, About Us, Timetable, Event, Service, and Contact Us pages. Clicking on the "About Us" button will direct you to the About Us page. For the Home, Timetable, Event, Service, and Contact us use the [Follow link] to access content on the Home page. 
*  For the Home, Timetable, Event, Service, and Contact us use the [Follow link] to access content on the Home page. In the section part, we provide a search button for linking to the “Search” page. Additionally, the article part below displays related information that can use mouseover but is unable to click on and links to any pages.


* “TIME TABLE” (e.g. the Northern line, Northeastern line, Southern line, Eastern line, Commuter line, Wongwian Yai line, Ban Laem line, and Tourist train line) 
* “NEW EVENTS” illustrates the information about the new event. 
* “OUR SERVICE” also illustrates the information about the service of ticket purchasing. 


The website's footer section contains details such as the address, call number, and various icons. 


* Login page: The login page includes the 2 main elements: Username or Email Address, a field where input the username or email address associated with their account. Password is a blank where the user enters their password for the account profile. After clicking the Login button, it will link to the “Welcome Admin” page.


* Welcome Admin page: The purpose of this page is to navigate administrators to select the next page. This page offers two options for selection: the Product/Service Management page and the User Account Management page. When clicking on the Product/Service Management button, the system will automatically redirect administrators to the Product/Service Management page. Similarly, if administrators upon clicking the User Account Management button, the system will direct administrators to the User Account Management page.


* Search page: The Search page includes 5 criteria to search which are round trip, departure station, terminal station, date, and the number of passengers. At the moment for phase I the javascript for checking the criteria from the input is excluded. For the mock-up search results will be shown on the same page below when clicking the search button. When you click on the "Read more detail" button, it will link to the Detail page where the user can view all the relevant information about the ticket.


* Detail page: There are 5 detail pages which are detail1.html, detail2.html, detail3.html, detail4.html, and detail5.html. All 5 detail pages have the same code structure except for the text detail in the mock-up ticket. On this page, you will find the details of the ticket at the front and back of the ticket which provides related information similar to real ticket details such as ticket id, passenger name, gender, ticket number, ticket type, train number, date, destination, and ticket price. Moreover, we use article elements to show precautions, terms & conditions, and cancellation details that show the image and information related to the usage of the ticket.


* Search result page: The purpose of this page is to display the search results once you have clicked on the "Back to previous page" button located at the bottom of the Detail page because the search results will only be displayed if you don't press the search button. Without clicking the "Search" button, you won't be able to view any search results.


* Product/Services management page: On this page, we need you to fill out the information for the new ticket as follows: Departure station, Terminal station, Ticket type, Train number, and Available date. Moreover, you can reset or add a new ticket. Furthermore, we also have a modified existing ticket part for administrators to modify the existing products(tickets). If they want to modify the information in the ticket can press the Edit button or can press on the delete button in order to delete the ticket. However, for now, the Add, Edit, and Delete buttons can not be used yet. But the Reset button can actually reset the input that has been filled out.


* User Account Management page: The function of a User Account Management page is to manage user accounts within the platform. In addition to displaying user information, it provides administrators to create, modify, or remove user accounts. For adding a new account, can be added from the Add Account button at the bottom of the page. After clicking the button, it will link to the Add Account pages for storing new user’s  information as a new admin. 


* Add Account page: The purpose of this page is to collect and save the information of a new administrator. The data collected will include the administrator’s name, username, email address, phone number, gender, and address. After the user completes the information, the user can click the Add button. It will enable the new user to access and perform administrative tasks using their new account. 


* About Us page: This page displays the creator's profile image, and personal details, including their name, contact information such as an address, phone number, email, and social media such as Instagram and LinkedIn. Additionally, it has "Email' and "LinkIn" buttons for communicating with the creator directly. This page also features a navigation bar that allows users to navigate to other pages without returning to the homepage.
